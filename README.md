## MY PORTFOLIO 

- The object of this assignment is to make myself a professional portfolio page with the multitude of projects I am going to be completing either entirely on my own or with a group of my peers to showcase the quality of work I provide. My overarching goal is also to make sure my portfolio is very responsive to the native screen sizes of different platforms it may be viewed on. 

- At first this portfolio page is going to showcase some photography I have taken over the past few years until I accumulate the projects in which we will work on through the year. Then as we progress through the year not only will the sections of my projects be updated but overall the entire structure will be revamped or updated with newly learned techniques as we progress. 

I hope you enjoy the progress you will see from me in my portfolio and hopefully my fellow peers in theirs as well!
